Fare Compare README.txt

Instructions to run code from VM:

    1 - cd into cs122-project
    2 - cd into mysite
    3 - run the following command: python manage.py runserver
    4 - copy server link and paste in browser
    5 - compare fares and times

Caveats:

    1 - This tool can only be used for intracity travel (not intercity).
    2 - Public transportation costs were not always readily available. In some situations,
        the same service is provided at difference costs. Best estimates were used, and in
        some cases, were simply not available. If this is the case, public transportation
        fare should read "$ Not available."
